# Eliteserien
A responsive and resilient table showing data from the Norwegian soccer/football league "Eliteserien".

## Technologies
[![Made with Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/fresh-badge.svg)](https://fresh.deno.dev)  
The project is built with Deno Fresh and hosted with Deno Deploy. I chose this stack because I wanted:
* Server Side Rendering
* A Resilient Site that works with Javascript disabled
* High performance
* Simple and free hosting
* A chance to explore Deno and Deno Fresh

## Resilience
The project is javascript independent, so you can disable javascript in dev tools if you like!

### Usage
You can find this project hosted here:

[olemak-eliteserien.deno.dev](https://olemak-eliteserien.deno.dev/)

To run locally, you will need **Deno**, a modern successor to Node built on TypeScript.Installation guide can be found here for various environments, as well as a downloadable installer: [Deno](https://deno.land/)


Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
